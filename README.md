# National Student Data Corps Projects

### Credit Score Classification
Here is a machine learning project I did for National Student Data Corps, in which I classified credit scores (good, poor, standard) from people's credit accounts:
- Developed classification models to predict credit scores in Python
- Explored data using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and statsmodels.Logit
- Built a gradient boosted decision tree and random forest tree using scikit-learn and achieved around 90% accuracy in both models
- Evaluated models using confusion matrix and overall accuracy and found that the outstanding debt is the most significant feature to the outcome

### California Housing Price Prediction
- Predicted California housing prices using dataset with 20,000 points in Python and R
- Created geospatial maps to display correlation between location, population, median age, and income
- Utlized feature correlation, multivariate regression, and correlation matrix
