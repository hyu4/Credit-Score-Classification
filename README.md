# NSDC Credit Score Classification
In this project, I developed classification models to predict credit scores in Python, in which I explored data using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and statsmodels.Logit.
I built a gradient boosted decision tree and random forest tree using scikit-learn and achieved around 90% accuracy in both models.
I evaluated models using confusion matrix and overall accuracy and found that the outstanding debt is the most significant feature to the outcome.
